# üå©Ô∏è Cloud Storage Project

## üìö Overview

Welcome to the Cloud Storage Project! This system offering a robust solution for storing and managing files across multiple nodes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **File Storage**: Files are stored across multiple storage nodes for redundancy, scalability, and fault tolerance.
- **Load Balancing**: Efficiently distributes client requests across available storage nodes to ensure optimal performance.
- **User Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanism before performing any file operations.
- **File Operations**: Supports `UPLOAD`, `DOWNLOAD`, `LIST`, and `DELETE` commands.
- **Service Registry**: Manages and tracks the status of all registered nodes (both storage nodes and load balancers).
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Continuously checks the health of storage nodes to ensure system reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for the project.
- **TCP/IP**: Network protocol for communication between nodes.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing metadata and managing user and file information.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for Java projects.
